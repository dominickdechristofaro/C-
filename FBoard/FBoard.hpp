** Title:       FBoard.hpp
** Description: A board game you play by moving x and o pieces with moveX and
                moveO.  The game will conintue to be unfinished until either the
                x-piece does not have a valid space to move, or the x-piece has
                reached row 7 of the gameboard. The x-piece may move diagonially
                in any direction and the o-pieces may move diagionally but only
                if their row does not decrease (they only move up the gameboard).
